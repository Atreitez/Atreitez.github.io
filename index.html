            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p> Hey there, I'm Atreitez McGaughy, navigating my maiden year in college with my sights set on a Computer Science degree. This chapter marks my inaugural plunge into the realm of coding, a thrilling journey that's been both challenging and incredibly rewarding. It's fascinating how this year has introduced me to the world of algorithms and programming languages, igniting a passion I never knew I had.

                Beyond the screen and the buzz of coding challenges, I find solace and joy in the simple pleasures of life. Hanging out with my squad of friends, diving into captivating novels that whisk me away to different worlds, and taking leisurely strolls through serene paths with my furry companionsâ€”these moments ground me amidst the fast-paced college life. It's in these moments that I find the balance and recharge to take on the exciting challenges that college and coding bring.
                
                As I navigate this exhilarating blend of academia and newfound passions, I'm thrilled about the endless possibilities ahead. Each day brings new lessons, not just in code but in life, and I'm here for the ride, soaking in every bit of knowledge and experience that comes my way.
